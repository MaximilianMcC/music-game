# How make a song
To make a song then make a `.song` file. The first section should contain a name, artist, mapper, difficult *(from 0 - 5, with 5 being hardest)*, the base64 of the cover-photo, and finally the base 64 of the song. A `#` is a comment btw. images need to be in `png` format, and songs need to be in `mp3` format👍👍👍
```
name: Song name here
artist: jeff
mapper: Bob

difficulty: 3


cover: 9j/4AAQSkZJR # etc...
song: SUQzBAAAAAAAI1R # etc...
```
To make the actual song then you use the rows and columns of the file to define the time and lane for the song to be played in. Each column is a lane (0-4 (x axis (left/right))) and each row (0-whatever (y axis (up/down))) is the time that the note is played (easy row is 0.5ms) !! also could do it where is the number of ms since the last note. if its a normal note then use a `#` character, if its a overdrive note then use a `@` character, and if its a holding note then use a `$` character. And if its noting then its a `.` character. This is what something could look like idk:
